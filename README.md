# Alexa-http-get
Recently an Amazon Dot v2.0 showed up and I wanted to control an Arcam amplifier with Alexa.

Aims
Voice control of the amplifier's volume and power.

Prerequisites
A server somewhere to receive http requests.  I built this one.

Try these commands
Alexa, tell Arcam to power on
Alexa, tell Arcam to power off
Alexa, tell Arcam to turn the volume up
Alexa, tell Arcam to mute
